Menace “learns” to play noughts and crosses by playing the game repeatedly against another player, each time refining its strategy until 
after having played a certain number of games it becomes almost perfect and its opponent is only able to draw or lose against it. The 
learning process involves being “punished” for losing and “rewarded” for drawing or winning.
